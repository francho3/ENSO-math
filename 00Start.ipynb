    "1. Introduction. Overview of the course. What is ENSO? Why do we care?\n",
    "2. Finding ENSO in the data. Walker. PCA of SST and SLP.(This will get used later for PCA of Nino 3.4, multivariate linear prediction, flavors).\n",
    "    1. Review SVD and relation to PCA. Use the chapter.\n",
    "3. Nino 3.4. If we just look at PC1, then we might as well just look at Nino 3.4. Analysis of cyclo-stationary data. Mean and variance that depend on month. Fourier fitting. Least-squares. AIC to choose the number of modes.\n",
    "4. Correlation/regression of Nino 3.4 with things. Impacts. Temperature. Precipitation. Significance testing. Multiple comparisons. Field significance. \n",
    "5. Serial correlation.  Autocorrelation. Autocorrelation as a function on month. AR models. Periodic AR models. Prediction. Selection of model order. AIC again. Model selection chapter from book. \n",
    "6. Probabilistic forecasts. From AR models. From dynamical models (ensembles). Categorical and continuous. \n",
    "7. Skill and quality assessment. Brier score. Log score. Reliability. ROC. Betting on ENSO.\n",
    "8. A little physics. ENSO is a coupled system. Knowing things other than Nino 3.4 help to predict Nino 3.4. Multivariate PC regression model (LIM) using SST. Subsurface? Train on observations or models.\n",
