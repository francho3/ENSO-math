# The mathematics of El Niño
## APMA 4990 Fall 2020
### T & TH 11:40am-12:55pm
M. K. Tippett mkt14@columbia.edu

### Goals/Outcomes
1. Learn basic properties of the El Nino-Southern Oscilation.
2. Do some applied math/climate science data analysis

### Overview
1. ENSO (El Niño - Southern Oscillation)
    1. What is ENSO?
    2. How is ENSO predicted?
    3. What are impacts of ENSO?
2. Math
    1. Descriptive statistics 
    2. Time series modeling
    3. Multivariate statistical analysis
3.  Lectures and activities use Python in Jupyter notebooks.
4. ENSO, math, and python material  will be self contained. 

### Structure
1. Two lectures per week. Reading assignments and homework.
    1. Theory (lecture, reading discusion)
    2. Practical data activity (introduction to the homework)
2. Homework approximately weekly
    1. Usually in the form of a Jupyter notebook
    2. Turn in using github or something
3. Final project
    1. Outline due a month or so before the end of the term
    2. Project presentations last week or so of class. 
    3. Final report due day of scheduled final.
    4. Reproduce/extend published work – original research (depending on ambition)
